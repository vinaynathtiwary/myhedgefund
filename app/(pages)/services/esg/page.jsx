                        With the changing external and internal environment, businesses are under constant pressure to maintain the effectiveness of their processes and controls. Any failure in executing or managing critical operations can not only impact the organisation to a great extent, but also creates a negative impression on the organisation’s stakeholder values. With an increase in corporate failures, there is an additional focus from regulators, financial institutions, as well as independent directors on the way various processes, controls and IT securities are being managed.
